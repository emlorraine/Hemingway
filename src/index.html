    <h1>Hunger in Public: The Language of Eating and the Public as Communion in Ernest Hemingway's "A Moveable Feast"</h1>
    <h2>The Big Picture:</h2>
    <p> When reflecting on his early years in writing after attempts in stateside journalism, Ernest Hemingway’s, “A Moveable Feast” paints a moody scape of Paris as he tries to establish himself as a writer. As Hemingway reflects on his years spent in France, he fixates on hunger as a consequence separate from food. Most commonly, Hemingway attaches his hunger to a desire for a kind of literary fulfillment in his writing. Collected, these anecdotes Hemingway writes about are bound by the title meaning of the phrase, “A moveable feast.” While Hemingway writes about oscillating between creative hunger and satiation, his narrative is framed by the physical sensation of hunger and satiation. For Hemingway, these frames are most present in public eating spaces like restaurants and cafes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With Paris as the backdrop for his memories, those cafes and restaurants serve as public monuments to Hemginway's creative communion. Hemginway's idea of a public space motivates the creative meaning behind his hunger while acknowledging the very real questions of material stability in pre-war Paris. Within this binary, the phrase "moveable feast" as an allegory of religious consumption presents an interesting tension when Hemingway writes about the physicality of restaurants and dining as public spaces. Just as in a religious context, Hemingway has a special treatment for eating in public as it allows for him to see himself within a greater artistic movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Hemingway, if he maintains the act of eating in public as an allegory for religious worship, such worship would take place in the cafes and restaurants that peppered the pre-war Parisian social scene. There is a linguistic texture to this tension that guides how Hemingway approaches this act of eating as an iteration of communion. In deconstructing “A Moveable Feast” to its constituent themes, there is a compelling degree of neutrality that orders how Hemingway writes about the architecture of and around eating. In this project, I intend to visualize the range of Hemingway’s sentiments across the entirety of the text in order to illustrate the consistency of how he writes about food and the engagement of eating in public spaces. In doing so, I hope to connect how Hemingway treats these restaurants and cafes as a cultural allegory for religious spaces to understand how Hemingway writes his creative work as an analogy to religious work.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>Natural-language processing is a field that employs tools from software development and linguistics to provide macro-level analysis of language and the constituent structures of language. For this project, I took a text file of Hemingway’s “A Moveable Feast” and mined the text for words that fulfilled a set of categories relating to food, restaurants, and the act of physically eating food. To process this data, I opted to use two measures of meaning: sentiment and polarity.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Sentiment analysis breaks down sentences and evaluates each statement’s relative positivity as informed by a corpus of words associated with scores. A score closer to zero indicates a less sentimental expression whereas a score closer to one indicates a more sentimental expression. Polarity analysis determines the subjectivity of a sentence by way of its structure and further sentiment analysis of sentences. A score closer to -1 indicates a less positive expression whereas a score closer to 1 indicates a more positive expression.
    </p>

    <p>
        To isolate keywords associated with public spaces and eating, I identified a set of words and searched over the corpus of statements. If a statement contained one of the set words or carried a similar meaning, I extracted that sentence from the memoir and performed further analysis to measure their similarity.

    <h2>Sentiment Analysis:</h2>
    <div id="sentiment"></div>

    <p>“A Moveable Feast” is punctuated by phrases that are highly subjective. As a memoir, the closeness of Hemginway’s emotions to his writing feels natural, however it is interesting to examine which of these sentiments are most expressive for Hemginway. In the context of food and eating, it is evident that Hemingway’s most expressive moments are linked to hunger.</p> 

    <p>Alice Camille writes in her essay, “Eat, Drink and Be Holy” about the textual significance of eating spaces and publicly available meals. Her argument acknowledges that the retelling of the Last Supper in the New Testament of The Bible appears in all of the gospels, the only other anecdote to get that treatment is the Crucifixion of Jesus. Using this fact, Camille writes how “When Jesus wanted to teach his followers, he told stories about food” (45 Camille). More than the food itself, Camille focuses on how the landscapes and sources of the food that are written into the Bible reinforce the important of very act of communion.</p>

    <p>By way of religious meaning, Camille associates the act of eating as an allegory for worship and belief. In a parallel manner, Hemingway calls on the same set of landscapes to write about food. Hemingway writes about this relationship between the lessons he learns as an artist and his eating quite plainly, especially as it relates to his ability to afford food:</p>

    <p class = "pull"></pclass>There was no one there they knew, and no one would have stared at them if they came. In those days many people went to the cafés at the corner of the Boulevard Montparnasse and the Boulevard Raspail to be seen publicly and in a way such places anticipated the columnists as the daily substitutes for immortality. (Heminway 81)</p>

    <p>The lack of hunger as a way to focus for Hemingway is interesting when he highlights him being alone in public still hungry. Creatively, he is starved and goes outside of his residence to find creative sustenance. This act reinforces how Hemingway handles the public as a mechanism for literary and physical fulfillment. Whether in a metaphorical sense or by way of literal feeling, Hemingway’s hunger attached to the texture of his language is natural given the context of the memoir, however it demands further inquiry when examining those sentences’ neighboring phrases. 
    <p>Just a few sentences before, Hemginway describes where he is about to eat by writing how, "Two of the waiters were our good friends" (Hemginway 81). By presenting this infomation as fact, he achieves a detachment which reinforces the cafe's assocation to his creative hunger in the above reference. Hemingway reserves on adjective for his friends--good. The brevity in this, comparative to the weight of descriptors he assigns to explain how such places wanted fellow writers to achieve some form of "immortality," once more puts pressure on the act of communing as critical to the place.</p> 
    <p>Void of any extended sentimentality, Hemingway builds out spaces to write about where people would eat. These flat descriptors put emphasis on the act of eating or not eating itself as a sort of performance. In doing this, Hemingway makes both eating and not eating as sacred to his memoir which reinforces the physical structures that facilitate and hinder those feelings as sacred.</p></p>


    <h2>Polarity Analysis:</h2>
    <div id="polarity"></div>

    <p>Intertextually, there is a peculiar relationship between how Hemingway writes about food as an object and food as part of a wider, public culture. Hemingway associates the physical nourishment of eating with a more abstract fulfillment relating to either his writing and his life in Paris. Textually, it is evident that this association is with eating in public spaces. When examining the relative sentimentality across the text, it is interesting to highlight the phrases around those with high polarity. The phrases with a high polar value-—often characterized by longer sentences with a higher concentration of adjectives and adverbs—-are surrounded by sentences with minimal subjectivity. Within the context of Hemginway’s fixation on food and eating, the shift in subjectivity reinforces Hemingway’s reliance on food as a system of social forces that rely on eating public spaces through interrogation of the phrases with the highest degrees of subjectivity.</p> 

    <p>Hemingway’s experience eating oysters provides an example of this. While Hemginway describes eating the oysters by writing:</p>

    <p class = "pull">As I ate the oysters with their strong taste of the sea and their faint metallic taste that the cold white wine washed away, leaving only the sea taste and the succulent texture, and as I drank their cold liquid from each shell and washed it down with the crisp taste of the wine, I lost the empty feeling and began to be happy and to make plans. (Hemingway 6)</p>

    <p>There is unique approach Hemingway takes to the oysters by associating their goodness to his emptiness following his creative success. In this instance, the food Hemginway consumes motivates the happiness he feels. The externality of this feeling reinforces how for Hemginway, it is not when he eats food but where. The texture of this language in this description, in particular, is once more tied to place. Rather than associating the oysters to Hemginway’s scene, he plays on the association of the oyster with its natural habitat, the sea. By calling in pronouns into how he writes these foods, like how the oysters have “their cold liquid” and “their strong taste” his physical relationship to the food he eats is emphasized. The specificity in doing this draws a broader relationship to how Hemingway sees food within a social system that extends to where he himself chooses to eat.</p>

    <p>This episode is proceeded by Hemingway finishing a story, writing how, “I was always empty and both sad and happy, as though I had made love, and I was sure this was a very good story although I would not know truly how good until I read it over the next day” (Hemingway 6). While Hemginway weaves his opinions on his story into the sentence, he writes his feeling empty, sad and happy as isolated states which scores quite low in their contextualized polarity. Similarly in the sentence following Hemingway eating the oysters, Hemingway pivots to his physical place, writing how “Now that the bad weather had come, we could leave Paris for a while,” (Hemingway 7). Once more, Hemingway does not indulge in descriptions for the spaces as he does with food because the sentence is not motivated by his feelings. Rather, those phrases state feelings as facts which subverts the role subjectivity plays into how Hemginway experiences food. By layering in overtly subjective phrases between setting descriptors, Hemginway centralizes the importance of place for those opinions across the entirety of the text. </p>


    <h2>The restaurants as a public space:</h2>

    <p>As Hemingway straddles his experience of both hunger and satiation in public, the social currency generated in consequence speak to how Hemginway relies on the public.  Beatrice Bruteau wrote in her essay, “Eating Together: The Shared Supper and the Covenant Community,” on eating as a symbol for social consumption. “We've got a whole culture, a whole civilization, a whole world running on this sense of value. This is much of what we're 'feeding on'. In this respect we are not 'eating together'. We've got separate tables for the various kinds of haves and have-nots,” Bruteau explained. While acknowledging the importance of space in eating, it is interesting to apply her argument to how Hemginway treats restaurants.</p> 

<p> Hemingway opts to eat when he has the funds to do so, but applies a certain urgency to eating following moments of creative or financial success as Bruteau suggests those that have affluency would. Hemingway also reflects the other perspective that hunger is just as important to the text, representing the moments where he fell into what Bruteau wrote as the “have nots.” What is shared by Hemingway’s experience of Bruteau’s analysis of eating is that his eating occurs in public. In that space, he shares in both those who are full and those who are hungry and communicates his desire via those public spaces.</p>

<p>Textually, this sharing is represented across the entire text. As moments of vulnerability relating to his writing, this binary shapes the memoir itself. Hemingway emphasizes moments of fulfillment and lacking by physically surrounding those moments by sentimentally neutral phrases. As a consequence of this construction, Hemingway is able to approach food as a means to express his creative desire for public response while allowing for those physical spaces to carry the burden of textual sentiment.</p>
