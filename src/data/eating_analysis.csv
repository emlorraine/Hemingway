"There is no mention of the Stade Anastasie where the boxers served as
waiters at the tables set out under the trees and the ring was in the
garden."
"Nor of training with Larry Gains, nor the great twenty-round
fights at the Cirque d’Hiver."
"_A Good Café on the Place St.-Michel_


Then there was the bad weather."
"The leaves lay sodden in the rain and the wind drove
the rain against the big green autobus at the terminal and the Café des
Amateurs was crowded and the windows misted over from the heat and the
smoke inside."
"The squat toilets of the old apartment houses, one by the
side of the stairs on each floor with the two cleated cement shoe-shaped
elevations on each side of the aperture so a _locataire_ would not slip,
emptied into cesspools which were emptied by pumping into horse-drawn
tank wagons at night."
"No one emptied the Café des Amateurs
though, and its yellowed poster stating the terms and penalties of the
law against public drunkenness was as flyblown and disregarded as its
clients were constant and ill-smelling."
"It was a pleasant café, warm and clean and friendly, and I hung up my
old waterproof on the coat rack to dry and put my worn and weathered
felt hat on the rack above the bench and ordered a _café au lait_."
"A girl came in the café and sat by herself at a table near the window."
"Now that the bad weather had come, we could leave Paris for a while for
a place where this rain would be snow coming down through the pines and
covering the road and the high hillsides and at an altitude where we
would hear it creak as we walked home at night."
"Geneviève through the rain, that
was now only local weather and not something that changed your life, to
the flat at the top of the hill."
"When I
was through working for the day I put away the notebook, or the paper,
in the drawer of the table and put any mandarines that were left in my
pocket."
"If I walked down by different streets to the Jardin du Luxembourg in the
afternoon I could walk through the gardens and then go to the Musée du
Luxembourg where the great paintings were that have now mostly been
transferred to the Louvre and the Jeu de Paume."
"My wife and I had called on Miss Stein, and she and the friend who lived
with her had been very cordial and friendly and we had loved the big
studio with the great paintings."
"It was like one of the best rooms in
the finest museum except there was a big fireplace and it was warm and
comfortable and they gave you good things to eat and tea and natural
distilled liqueurs made from purple plums, yellow plums or wild
raspberries."
"She was working on a piece of needlepoint when we
first met them and she worked on this and saw to the food and drink and
talked to my wife."
"They seemed to like us too and
treated us as though we were very good, well mannered and promising
children and I felt that they forgave us for being in love and being
married—time would fix that—and when my wife invited them to tea, they
accepted."
"I know that I was walking myself, since we could not
afford a dog nor even a cat then, and the only cats I knew were in the
cafés or small restaurants or the great cats that I admired in
concierges’ windows."
"But she disliked the drudgery of revision and the obligation to make her
writing intelligible, although she needed to have publication and
official acceptance, especially for the unbelievably long book called
_The Making of Americans_."
"This book began magnificently, went on very well for a long way with
great stretches of great brilliance and then went on endlessly in
repetitions that a more conscientious and less lazy writer would have
put in the waste basket."
"For publication in the review I had to read all of Miss
Stein’s proof for her as this was a work which gave her no happiness."
"“But what about the old man with beautiful manners and a great name who
came to the hospital in Italy and brought me a bottle of Marsala or
Campari and behaved perfectly, and then one day I would have to tell the
nurse never to let that man into the room again?” I asked."
"It was sad when the park was closed and locked and I was sad
walking around it instead of through it and in a hurry to get home to
the rue Cardinal Lemoine."
"I was not at all
sad when I got home to the rue Cardinal Lemoine and told my newly
acquired knowledge to my wife."
"_“Une Génération Perdue”_


It was easy to get into the habit of stopping in at 27 rue de Fleurus
late in the afternoon for the warmth and the great pictures and the
conversation."
"When I first met her
she did not speak of Sherwood Anderson as a writer but spoke glowingly
of him as a man and of his great, beautiful, warm Italian eyes and of
his kindness and his charm."
"I did not care about his great beautiful
warm Italian eyes but I liked some of his short stories very much."
"You could always mention a
general, though, that the general you were talking to had beaten."
"The
general you were talking to would praise the beaten general greatly and
go happily into detail on how he had beaten him."
"She was angry at Ezra Pound because he had sat down too quickly on a
small, fragile and, doubtless, uncomfortable chair, that it is quite
possible he had been given on purpose, and had either cracked or broken
it."
"That he was a great poet and a gentle and generous man and could
have accommodated himself in a normal-size chair was not considered."
"You drink
yourselves to death....”

“Was the young mechanic drunk?” I asked."
"But that
night walking home I thought about the boy in the garage and if he had
ever been hauled in one of those vehicles when they were converted to
ambulances."
"Then as I was getting up
to the Closerie des Lilas with the light on my old friend, the statue of
Marshal Ney with his sword out and the shadows of the trees on the
bronze, and he alone there and nobody behind him and what a fiasco he’d
made of Waterloo, I thought that all generations were lost by something
and always had been and always would be and I stopped at the Lilas to
keep the statue company and drank a cold beer before going home to the
flat over the sawmill."
"But sitting there with the beer, watching the
statue and remembering how many days Ney had fought, personally, with
the rear-guard on the retreat from Moscow that Napoleon had ridden away
from in the coach with Caulaincourt, I thought of what a warm and
affectionate friend Miss Stein had been and how beautifully she had
spoken of Apollinaire and of his death on the day of the Armistice in
1918 with the crowd shouting “_à bas Guillaume_” and Apollinaire, in his
delirium, thinking they were crying against him, and I thought, I will
do my best to serve her and see she gets justice for the good work she
had done as long as I can, so help me God and Mike Ney."
"When I got
home and into the courtyard and upstairs and saw my wife and my son and
his cat, F. Puss, all of them happy and a fire in the fireplace, I said
to my wife, “You know, Gertrude _is_ nice, anyway.”

“Of course, Tatie.”

“But she does talk a lot of rot sometimes.”

“I never hear her,” my wife said."
"On a cold windswept
street, this was a warm, cheerful place with a big stove in winter,
tables and shelves of books, new books in the window, and photographs on
the wall of famous writers both dead and living."
"“Haven’t you ever seen him?”

“We’ve seen him at Michaud’s eating with his family,” I said."
"“But it’s
not polite to look at people when they are eating, and Michaud’s is
expensive.”

“Do you eat at home?”

“Mostly now,” I said."
"“We have a good cook.”

“There aren’t any restaurants in your immediate quarter, are there?”

“No."
"“He liked it very much except for
that.”

“The nearest good cheap place to eat is over by the Panthéon.”

“I don’t know that quarter."
"We eat at home."
"Home in the rue Cardinal Lemoine was a two-room flat that had no hot
water and no inside toilet facilities except an antiseptic container,
not uncomfortable to anyone who was used to a Michigan outhouse."
"With a
fine view and a good mattress and springs for a comfortable bed on the
floor, and pictures we liked on the walls, it was a cheerful, gay flat."
"We can walk anywhere and we can stop at some new café where we
don’t know anyone and nobody knows us and have a drink.”

“We can have two drinks.”

“Then we can eat somewhere.”

“No."
"Don’t forget we have to pay the library.”

“We’ll come home and eat here and we’ll have a lovely meal and drink
Beaune from the co-operative you can see right out of the window there
with the price of the Beaune on the window."
"Now we’d better have lunch.”

“I’m very hungry,” I said."
"What do we have for lunch?”

“Little radishes, and good _foie de veau_ with mashed potatoes and an
endive salad."
"The Tour
D’Argent restaurant had a few rooms above the restaurant that they
rented in those days, giving the people who lived there a discount in
the restaurant, and if the people who lived there left any books behind
there was a bookstall not far along the quai where the _valet de
chambre_ sold them and you could buy them from the proprietress for a
very few francs."
"You went down a stairway to the park and watched the
fishermen there and under the great bridge."
"They were delicious fried
whole and I could eat a plateful."
"One of the best places to eat them was at an open-air restaurant built
out over the river at Bas Meudon where we would go when we had money for
a trip away from our quarter."
"You did not have to go that far to eat _goujon_."
"But I followed it closely and it was interesting and good to know about,
and it always made me happy that there were men fishing in the city
itself, having sound, serious fishing and taking a few _fritures_ home
to their families."
"With the fishermen and the life on the river, the beautiful barges with
their own life on board, the tugs with their smoke-stacks that folded
back to pass under the bridges, pulling a tow of barges, the great elms
on the stone banks of the river, the plane trees and in some places the
poplars, I could never be lonely along the river."
"Sometimes the heavy cold
rains would beat it back so that it would seem that it would never come
and that you were losing a season out of your life."
"She wore her felt-soled
cleaning shoes and I only heard her breathing as she stopped on the
stairs outside our door and then the shutting of her door."
"The goats were going down the rue
Descartes and I breathed the air in and walked back fast to climb the
stairs and get my work done."
"They were running at Enghien, the small, pretty
and larcenous track that was the home of the outsider."
"There was always the public
bathhouse down at the foot of the street by the river."
"It had never seemed
strange to me to wear sweatshirts for underwear to keep warm."
"We’ll take a lunch and some wine."
"It was early and we sat on my raincoat on the fresh cropped grass
bank and had our lunch and drank from the wine bottle and looked at the
old grandstand, the brown wooden betting booths, the green of the track,
the darker green of the hurdles, and the brown shine of the water jumps
and the whitewashed stone walls and white posts and rails, the paddock
under the new leafed trees and the first horses being walked to the
paddock."
"But they may have bet him at the last.”

The horses came by, ours wet, with his nostrils working wide to breathe,
the jockey patting him."
"Another day later that year when we had come back from one of our
voyages and had good luck at some track again we stopped at Pruniers on
the way home, going in to sit at the bar after looking at all the
clearly priced wonders in the window."
"It was the vine that was important, Tatie.”

“Do you remember I brought some wine from Aigle home to the chalet?"
"Aren’t you?”

“Let’s go to a wonderful place and have a truly grand dinner.”

“Where?”

“Michaud’s?”

“That’s perfect and it’s so close.”

So we walked up the rue des Saints-Pères to the corner of the rue Jacob
stopping and looking in the windows at pictures and at furniture."
"We
stood outside of Michaud’s restaurant reading the posted menu."
"Michaud’s
was crowded and we waited for people to come out, watching the tables
where people already had their coffee."
"We were hungry again from walking and Michaud’s was an exciting and
expensive restaurant for us."
"It was where Joyce ate with his family
then, he and his wife against the wall, Joyce peering at the menu
through his thick glasses holding the menu up in one hand; Nora by him,
a hearty but delicate eater; Giorgio thin, foppish, sleek-headed from
the back; Lucia with heavy curly hair, a girl not quite yet grown; all
of them talking Italian."
"You do, don’t you?”

It was a wonderful meal at Michaud’s after we got in; but when we had
finished and there was no question of hunger any more the feeling that
had been like hunger when we were on the bridge was still there when we
caught the bus home."
"But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple
there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right
and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the
moonlight."
"But it was not the climbs in the high mountain meadows
above the last forest, nor nights coming home to the chalet, nor was it
climbing with Chink, our best friend, over a high pass into new country."
"I, the one who was so righteous about people and
their destructiveness, tolerated this friend that was the falsest, most
beautiful, most exciting, vicious, and demanding because she could be
profitable."
"To make it profitable was more than a full-time job and I
had no time for that."
"You watched the prices and all the shifts of
odds each time a horse you were following would start, and you had to
know how he was working and finally get to know when the stable would
try with him."
"He always might be beaten when he tried; but you should
know by then what his chances were."
"It was hard work but at Auteuil it
was beautiful to watch each day they raced when you could be there and
see the honest races with the great horses, and you got to know the
course as well as any place you had ever known."
"“Want to go to lunch?” I asked Mike."
"Aren’t you going to the
track?”

“No.”

We had lunch at the square Louvois at a very good, plain bistro with a
wonderful white wine."
"One with great horses.”

We spread paté on the good bistro bread and drank the white wine."
"But I will get the Vélodrome
d’Hiver with the smoky light of the afternoon and the high-banked wooden
track and the whirring sound the tires made on the wood as the riders
passed, the effort and the tactics as the riders climbed and plunged,
each one a part of his machine; I will get the magic of the _demi-fond_,
the noise of the motors with their rollers set out behind them that the
_entraîneurs_ rode, wearing their heavy crash helmets and leaning
backward in their ponderous leather suits, to shelter the riders who
followed them from the air resistance, the riders in their lighter crash
helmets bent low over their handlebars their legs turning the huge gear
sprockets and the small front wheels touching the roller behind the
machine that gave them shelter to ride in, and the duels that were more
exciting than anything, the _put-put_ing of the motorcycles and the
riders elbow to elbow and wheel to wheel up and down and around at
deadly speed until one man could not hold the pace and broke away and
the solid wall of air that he had been sheltered against hit him."
"The straight sprints raced in heats
or in match races where the two riders would balance for long seconds on
their machines for the advantage of making the other rider take the lead
and then the slow circling and the final plunge into the driving purity
of speed."
"There were the programs of the team races of two hours, with a
series of pure sprints in their heats to fill the afternoon, the lonely
absolute speed events of one man racing an hour against the clock, the
terribly dangerous and beautiful races of one hundred kilometers on the
big banked wooden five-hundred-meter bowl of the Stade Buffalo, the
outdoor stadium at Montrouge where they raced behind big motorcycles,
Linart, the great Belgian champion that they called “the Sioux” for his
profile, dropping his head to suck up cherry brandy from a rubber tube
that connected with a hot water bottle under his racing shirt when he
needed it toward the end as he increased his savage speed, and the
championships of France behind big motors of the
six-hundred-and-sixty-meter cement track of the Parc du Prince near
Auteuil, the wickedest track of all where we saw that great rider Ganay
fall and heard his skull crumple under the crash helmet as you crack an
hard-boiled egg against a stone to peel it on a picnic."
"_Hunger Was Good Discipline_


You got very hungry when you did not eat enough in Paris because all the
bakery shops had such good things in the windows and people ate outside
at tables on the sidewalk so that you saw and smelled the food."
"When you
had given up journalism and were writing nothing that anyone in America
would buy, explaining at home that you were lunching out with someone,
the best place to go was the Luxembourg gardens where you saw and
smelled nothing to eat all the way from the Place de l’Observatoire to
the rue de Vaugirard."
"I used to wonder if he were hungry too when he
painted; but I thought possibly it was only that he had forgotten to
eat."
"After you came out of the Luxembourg you could walk down the narrow rue
Férou to the Place St.-Sulpice and there were still no restaurants, only
the quiet square with its benches and trees."
"From this square you could not go further toward the river without
passing shops selling fruits, vegetables, wines, or bakery and pastry
shops."
"But by choosing your way carefully you could work to your right
around the grey and white stone church and reach the rue de l’Odéon and
turn up to your right toward Sylvia Beach’s bookshop and on your way you
did not pass too many places where things to eat were sold."
"The rue de
l’Odéon was bare of eating places until you reached the square where
there were three restaurants."
"“Are you eating enough?”

“Sure.”

“What did you eat for lunch?”

My stomach would turn over and I would say, “I’m going home for lunch
now.”

“At three o’clock?”

“I didn’t know it was that late.”

“Adrienne said the other night she wanted to have you and Hadley for
dinner."
"Don’t you work so hard now that you don’t eat
properly.”

“I won’t.”

“Get home now before it’s too late for lunch.”

“They’ll save it.”

“Don’t eat cold food either."
"Eat a good hot lunch.”

“Did I have any mail?”

“I don’t think so."
"But promise me you
won’t worry and that you’ll eat enough.”

“I promise.”

“Then get home now and have lunch.”

Outside on the rue de l’Odéon I was disgusted with myself for having
complained about things."
"I should have bought a large piece of bread and
eaten it instead of skipping a meal."
"Eating is wonderful too
and do you know where you are going to eat right now?"
"Lipp’s is where you are going to eat and drink too."
"There were few people in the _brasserie_ and when I sat down
on the bench against the wall with the mirror in back and a table in
front and the waiter asked if I wanted beer I asked for a _distingué_,
the big glass mug that held a liter, and for potato salad."
"I knew the stories were good and
someone would publish them finally at home."
"I had never seen
anyone hurt by a thing other than death or unbearable suffering except
Hadley when she told me about the things being gone."
"It is necessary to handle yourself better when you have to cut down on
food so you will not get too much hunger-thinking."
"Oh sure, I thought, I’m so far ahead of them
now that I can’t afford to eat regularly."
"But it seemed an impossible thing to do
when I had been trying with great difficulty to write paragraphs that
would be the distillation of what made a novel."
"I was damned if
I would write one because it was what I should do if we were to eat
regularly."
"By this time I had paid the check and gone out and turned to the right
and crossed the rue de Rennes so that I would not go to the Deux-Magots
for coffee and was walking up the rue Bonaparte on the shortest way
home."
"The waiter brought me a _café crème_ and I
drank half of it when it cooled and left it on the table while I wrote."
"It was warm inside in the winter and in the
spring and fall it was very fine outside with the tables under the shade
of the trees on the side where the statue of Marshal Ney was, and the
square, regular tables under the big awnings along the boulevard."
"In those days many people went
to the cafés at the corner of the Boulevard Montparnasse and the
Boulevard Raspail to be seen publicly and in a way such places
anticipated the columnists as the daily substitutes for immortality."
"These people made it a comfortable café since they were all interested
in each other and in their drinks or coffees, or infusions, and in the
papers and periodicals which were fastened to rods, and no one was on
exhibition."
"On this evening I was sitting at a table outside of the Lilas watching
the light change on the trees and the buildings and the passage of the
great slow horses of the outer boulevards."
"The door of the café opened
behind me and to my right, and a man came out and walked to my table."
"It was Ford Madox Ford, as he called himself then, and he was breathing
heavily through a heavy, stained mustache and holding himself as upright
as an ambulatory, well clothed, up-ended hogshead."
"The waiter, who was tall and thin and bald on the top of his
head with hair slicked over and who wore a heavy old-style dragoon
mustache, repeated the order."
"I had always avoided looking at Ford when I could and I always held my
breath when I was near him in a closed room, but this was the open air
and the fallen leaves blew along the sidewalks from my side of the table
past his, so I took a good look at him, repented, and looked across the
boulevard."
"He was with a tall woman and he glanced at our table and then away and
went on his way down the boulevard."
"He looked like a man who had been
thinking of something and had glanced at the table almost automatically."
"I thought it would have been pleasant if Belloc had stopped at the table
and I might have met him."
"The waiter Emile, who had replaced Jean on duty,
came to the table to see the results of the last race at Auteuil."
"A
great friend of mine who rarely came to the Lilas came over to the table
and sat down, and just then as my friend was ordering a drink from Emile
the gaunt man in the cape with the tall woman passed us on the sidewalk."
"His glance drifted toward the table and then away."
"_Birth of a New School_


The blue-backed notebooks, the two pencils and the pencil sharpener (a
pocket knife was too wasteful), the marble-topped tables, the smell of
early morning, sweeping out and mopping, and luck were all you needed."
"A pencil-lead might break off in the conical nose of the pencil
sharpener and you would use the small blade of the pen knife to clear it
or else sharpen the pencil carefully with the sharp blade and then slip
your arm through the sweat-salted leather of your pack strap to lift the
pack again, get the other arm through and feel the weight settle on your
back and feel the pine needles under your moccasins as you started down
for the lake."
"If you could keep your temper it would be
better but I was not good at keeping mine then and said, “You rotten son
of a bitch what are you doing in here off your filthy beat?”

“Don’t be insulting just because you want to act like an eccentric.”

“Take your dirty camping mouth out of here.”

“It’s a public café."
"There were other good cafés to work in but they were a long
walk away and this was my home café."
"What’s wrong with that?”

“At home they’d serve you and then break the glass.”

“Where’s home?"
"It sounds like a charming place.”

He was sitting at the next table, a tall fat young man with spectacles."
"“I suppose you’ve gotten so great nobody can speak to you.”

I wrote another sentence that ended the paragraph and read it over."
"Go home."
"It’s creative too.”

“Creation’s probably overrated."
"After all, God made the world in only
six days and rested on the seventh.”

“Of course there’s nothing to prevent me doing creative writing too.”

“Not a thing."
"So the
next morning I woke early, boiled the rubber nipples and the bottles,
made the formula, finished the bottling, gave Mr. Bumby a bottle and
worked on the dining-room table before anyone but he, F. Puss the cat,
and I were awake."
"The
lights were on in the bakery and outside it was the end of the day and I
walked in the early dusk up the street and stopped outside the terrace
of the Nègre de Toulouse restaurant where our red and white checkered
napkins were in the wooden napkin rings in the napkin rack waiting for
us to come to dinner."
"But
there were always much nicer-looking people that I did not know that, in
the evening with the lights just coming on, were hurrying to some place
to drink together, to eat together and then to make love."
"By any standards we were still very poor and I still made such small
economies as saying that I had been asked out for lunch and then
spending two hours walking in the Luxembourg gardens and coming back to
describe the marvelous lunch to my wife."
"When you are twenty-five and
are a natural heavyweight, missing a meal makes you very hungry."
"But it
also sharpens all of your perceptions, and I found that many of the
people I wrote about had very strong appetites and a great taste and
desire for food, and most of them were looking forward to having a
drink."
"At home, over the sawmill, we had a Corsican wine that had great
authority and a low price."
"In Paris,
then, you could live very well on almost nothing and by skipping meals
occasionally and never buying any new clothes, you could save and have
luxuries."
"I went over and sat down at a table with Pascin and two models who were
sisters."
"But I said it.”

“Let’s be comfortable,” Pascin said."
"“The serious young writer and the
friendly wise old painter and the two beautiful young girls with all of
life before them.”

We sat there and the girls sipped at their drinks and Pascin drank
another _fine à l’eau_ and I drank the beer; but no one was comfortable
except Pascin."
"The dark girl was restless and she sat on display turning
her profile and letting the light strike the concave planes of her face
and showing me her breasts under the hold of the black sweater."
"“Do you have to model that
sweater now at the café?”

“It pleases me,” she said."
"“If you think I’m in love with canvases, I’ll paint
you tomorrow in water colors.”

“When do we eat?” her sister asked."
"“And where?”

“Will you eat with us?” the dark girl asked."
"I go to eat with my _légitime_.” That was what they said then."
"“All right, my children, I will drink
another and then we eat where you wish.”

“Chez Viking,” the dark girl said."
"It had very good light and was heated by a stove and it had paintings by
Japanese artists that Ezra knew."
"I never countered but kept Ezra moving
after me sticking out his left hand and throwing a few right hands and
then said we were through and washed down with a pitcher of water and
toweled off and put on my sweatshirt."
"Some people show evil as a
great race horse shows breeding."
"Walking home I tried to think what he reminded me of and there were
various things."
"We’re just going to have dinner.”

About a week afterwards I met Miss Stein and told her I’d met Wyndham
Lewis and asked her if she had ever met him."
"I cannot remember how Bel Esprit finally cracked up but I
think it had something to do with the publication of _The Waste Land_
which won the Major the Dial award and not long after a lady of title
backed a review for Eliot called _The Criterion_ and Ezra and I did not
have to worry about him any more."
"There is not much future in
men being friends with great women although it can be pleasant enough
before it gets better or worse, and there is usually even less future
with truly ambitious women writers."
"One time when I gave the excuse for
not having stopped in at 27 rue de Fleurus for some time that I did not
know whether Miss Stein would be at home, she said, “But Hemingway, you
have the run of the place."
"Come in
any time and the maidservant”—she used her name but I have forgotten
it—“will look after you and you must make yourself at home until I
come.”

I did not abuse this but sometimes I would stop in and the maidservant
would give me a drink and I would look at the pictures and if Miss Stein
did not turn up I would thank the maidservant and leave a message and go
away."
"Please don’t, pussy.”

I swallowed the drink and put the glass down on the table and started
for the door."
"It was sad to see new
worthless pictures hung in with the great pictures but it made no
difference any more."
"_The Man Who Was Marked for Death_


The afternoon I met Ernest Walsh, the poet, in Ezra’s studio, he was
with two girls in long mink coats and there was a long, shiny, hired car
from Claridge’s outside in the street with a uniformed chauffeur."
"Ernest Walsh was dark, intense, faultlessly Irish, poetic and clearly
marked for death as a character is marked for death in a motion picture."
"“He must be a very great poet,” I said."
"Walsh was still talking
to Ezra with great intensity."
"The next I heard from Ezra about Walsh was that he had been bailed out
of Claridge’s by some lady admirers of poetry and of young poets who
were marked for death, and the next thing, some time after that, was
that he had financial backing from another source and was going to start
a new magazine in the quarter as a co-editor."
"It was not long after I heard rumors of this alleged award that Walsh
asked me to lunch one day at a restaurant that was the best and the most
expensive in the Boulevard St.-Michel quarter and after the oysters,
expensive flat faintly coppery _marennes_, not the familiar, deep,
inexpensive _portugaises_, and a bottle of Pouilly Fuisé, began to lead
up to it delicately."
"He did
not bother to look marked for death with me and this was a relief."
"He
knew I knew he had the con, not the kind you con with but the kind you
died of then and how bad it was, and he did not bother to have to cough,
and I was grateful for this at the table."
"I was wondering if he ate the
flat oysters in the same way the whores in Kansas City, who were marked
for death and practically everything else, always wished to swallow
semen as a sovereign remedy against the con; but I did not ask him."
"“Ezra’s a great, great poet,” Walsh said, looking at me with his own
dark poet’s eyes."
"“Joyce is great,” Walsh said."
"“Great."
"Great.”

“Great,” I said."
"“Everybody has something wrong with them,” I said, trying to cheer up
the lunch."
"“You haven’t.” He gave me all his charm and more, and then he marked
himself for death."
"“You mean I am not marked for death?” I asked."
"It came as we finished the steak and french-fried potatoes and were
two-thirds through the Châteauneuf du Pape which is not a luncheon wine."
"“There’s no use beating around the bush,” he said."
"It made me feel sick for people to talk about my
writing to my face, and I looked at him and his marked-for-death look
and I thought, you con man conning me with your con."
"I’ve seen a
battalion in the dust on the road, a third of them for death or worse
and no special marks on them, the dust for all, and you and your marked
for death look, you con man, making a living out of your death."
"Death was not conning
with him."
"In Toronto, before we had ever come to Paris, I had been told Katherine
Mansfield was a good short-story writer, even a great short-story
writer, but trying to read her after Chekov was like hearing the
carefully artificial tales of a young old-maid compared to those of an
articulate and knowing physician who was a good and simple writer."
"To have come
on all this new world of writing, with time to read in a city like Paris
where there was a way of living well and working, no matter how poor you
were, was like having a great treasure given to you."
"I remember asking Ezra once when we had walked home from playing tennis
out on the Boulevard Arago, and he had asked me into his studio for a
drink, what he really thought about Dostoyevsky."
"I called up
the stairs but there was no one home."
"Let’s talk about something else, should we?”

There was no one sitting on the terrace and the whisky was warming us
both although I was better dressed for the fall than Evan as I wore a
sweatshirt for underwear and then a shirt and a blue wool French
sailor’s sweater over the shirt."
"But it comes out as a
hell of a novel, the greatest I suppose, and you can read it over and
over.”

“I know,” I said."
"But then it will start to
make you angry, no matter how great it is.”

“Well, we were lucky to have had it to read the first time and maybe
there will be a better translation.”

“But don’t let it tempt you, Hem.”

“I won’t."
"Dunning was Ralph Cheever Dunning, a poet who
smoked opium and forgot to eat."
"Finally after a night with Dunning waiting for death to come, the matter
was put in the hands of a physician and Dunning was taken to a private
clinic to be disintoxicated."
"I retreated and he hit me with yet another
milk bottle in the back."
"But Ezra,
who was a very great poet, played a good game of tennis too."
"I was very curious to see him and I had been working very hard all day
and it seemed quite wonderful that here should be Scott Fitzgerald and
the great Dunc Chaplin whom I had never heard of but who was now my
friend."
"Scott did not stop talking and since I was embarrassed by what
he said—it was all about my writing and how great it was—I kept on
looking at him closely and noticed instead of listening."
"Until
then I had felt that what a great writer I was had been carefully kept
secret between myself and my wife and only those people we knew well
enough to speak to."
"I was glad Scott had come to the same happy
conclusion as to this possible greatness, but I was also glad he was
beginning to run out of the speech."
"I wondered if he gave everyone
the speech, but I didn’t think so because I had watched him sweat while
he was making it."
"The sweat had come out on his long, perfect Irish
upper lip in tiny drops, and that was when I had looked down away from
his face and checked on the length of his legs, drawn up as he sat on
the bar stool."
"As he sat there at the bar holding the glass of champagne the skin
seemed to tighten over his face until all the puffiness was gone and
then it drew tighter until the face was like a death’s head."
"His face became a true death’s head, or death mask, in
front of my eyes."
"“He’ll probably be all right by the
time he gets home,” he said."
"I simply got tired of
those absolutely bloody British you were with and went home.”

“There weren’t any British there when you were there."
"He wanted me to read the new
book, _The Great Gatsby_, as soon as he could get his last and only copy
back from someone he had loaned it to."
"He told me that he and Zelda, his wife, had been compelled to abandon
their small Renault motor car in Lyon because of bad weather and he
asked me if I would go down to Lyon with him on the train to pick up the
car and drive up with him to Paris."
"We planned to get into Lyon, have the car checked and in good
shape, have an excellent dinner and get an early-morning start back
towards Paris."
"It is
strange now to remember thinking of Scott as an older writer, but at the
time, since I had not yet read _The Great Gatsby_, I thought of him as a
much older writer."
"I had received
an advance of two hundred dollars from Boni and Liveright for a first
book of short stories to be published in America that fall, and I was
selling stories to the _Frankfurter Zeitung_ and to _Der Querschnitt_ in
Berlin and to _This Quarter_ and _The Transatlantic Review_ in Paris and
we were living with great economy and not spending any money except for
necessities in order to save money to go down to the _feria_ at Pamplona
in July and to Madrid and to the _feria_ in Valencia afterwards."
"In those days I had a very bad, quick temper, but by the time we were
through Montereau it had quieted down and I was not too angry to watch
and enjoy the countryside and at noon I had a good lunch in the dining
car and drank a bottle of St.-Émilion and thought that even if I had
been a damned fool to accept an invitation for a trip that was to be
paid for by someone else, and was spending money on it that we needed to
go to Spain, it was a good lesson for me."
"I had never before accepted an
invitation to go on any trip that was paid for, instead of the cost
split, and in this one I had insisted that we split the cost of the
hotels and meals."
"He said there was no money in eating fire nor in feats of
strength with fingers and jaws in Lyon."
"False fire-eaters had ruined the
_métier_ and would continue to ruin it wherever they were allowed to
practice."
"He had been eating fire all evening, he said, and did not have
enough money on him to eat anything else that night."
"I asked him to have
another drink, to wash away the petrol taste of the fire-eating, and
said we could have dinner together if he knew a good place that was
cheap enough."
"We ate very cheaply in an Algerian restaurant and I liked the food and
the Algerian wine."
"The fire-eater was a nice man and it was interesting
to see him eat, as he could chew with his gums as well as most people
can with their teeth."
"It was getting time for me to get back
to the hotel and check on Scott again, so I paid for the meal and said
we would certainly be running into each other again."
"I left him
straightening out bent coins and stacking them on the table and walked
back to the hotel."
"For years I had heard about the wonderful chicken in the
restaurants there, but we had eaten mutton instead."
"I was shaving in the morning getting
ready to go out for breakfast when they called from the desk saying a
gentleman was downstairs to see me."
"It was a very comfortable train
and we might just as well have come down together.”

“Have you had breakfast?”

“Not yet."
"“Didn’t they tell you at home that I was
here?”

“No."
"The
whole trip has been disastrous so far.”

“Let’s get some breakfast and find the car and roll,” I said."
"Should we have breakfast here?”

“It would be quicker in a café.”

“But we’re sure to get a good breakfast here.”

“All right.”

It was a big American breakfast with ham and eggs and it was very good."
"But by the time we had ordered it, waited for it, eaten it, and waited
to pay for it, close to an hour had been lost."
"It was not until the
waiter came with the bill that Scott decided that we have the hotel make
us a picnic lunch."
"Or, if things were closed when we went
through, there would be any number of restaurants where we could stop on
our way."
"So the hotel made us
a lunch that could not have cost us very much more than four or five
times what it would have cost us if we had bought it ourselves."
"So we had a whisky and
Perrier in the bar while we waited for the lunch and both felt much
better."
"He showed me
how it had heated up and burned the paint off the motor."
"We had a marvelous lunch from the hotel at Lyon, an excellent
truffled roast chicken, delicious bread and white Mâcon wine and Scott
was very happy when we drank the white Mâconnais at each of our stops."
"I had listened to his chest and
had him breathe deeply, and his chest sounded all right."
"Scott was lying with his eyes closed,
breathing slowly and carefully and, with his waxy color and his perfect
features, he looked like a little dead crusader."
"I was getting tired of
the literary life, if this was the literary life that I was leading, and
already I missed not working and I felt the death loneliness that comes
at the end of every day that is wasted in your life."
"Back in the room Scott was still lying as though on his tomb, sculpted
as a monument to himself, his eyes closed and breathing with exemplary
dignity."
"In Europe then we thought of wine as something as healthy and normal as
food and also as a great giver of happiness and well being and delight."
"Drinking wine was not a snobbism nor a sign of sophistication nor a
cult; it was as natural as eating and to me as necessary, and I would
not have thought of eating a meal without drinking either wine or cider
or beer."
"Tonight I would have much
preferred to be in a café where I might read the morning editions of the
Paris papers and watch the people and drink something a little more
authoritative than the Mâcon in preparation for dinner."
"I thought of
telling Scott about this whole problem of the Lilas, although I had
probably mentioned it to him before, but I knew he did not care about
waiters nor their problems nor their great kindnesses and affections."
"“Why don’t you rest and have some dinner in bed?”

“I want my temperature taken.”

After this went on for a long time the waiter brought a thermometer."
"I’ve always
had great recuperative power.”

“You’re fine,” I said."
"I knew him for two years before he could spell my
name; but then it was a long name to spell and perhaps it became harder
to spell all of the time, and I give him great credit for spelling it
correctly finally."
"On this night though he wanted me to know and understand and appreciate
what it was that had happened at St.-Raphael and I saw it so clearly
that I could see the single seater seaplane buzzing the diving raft and
the color of the sea and the shape of the pontoons and the shadow that
they cast and Zelda’s tan and Scott’s tan and the dark blonde and the
light blond of their hair and the darkly tanned face of the boy that was
in love with Zelda."
"Our clothes came before the call did and we dressed and went downstairs
to have dinner."
"We had eaten very
good cold chicken at noon but this was still famous chicken country, so
we had _poularde de Bresse_ and a bottle of Montagny, a light, pleasant
white wine of the neighborhood."
"He passed out at the table with his head on his
hands."
"It was natural and there was no theater about it and it even
looked as though he were careful not to spill nor break things."
"Downstairs I finished my dinner and thought about Scott."
"My training
was never to drink after dinner nor before I wrote nor while I was
writing."
"At meals I ordered one bottle of the lightest wine I could
locate and told Scott he would do me a great favor if he would not let
me order any more as I had to train before I wrote and should not under
any circumstances drink more than half a bottle."
"When I had left him at his home and taken a taxi back to the sawmill, it
was wonderful to see my wife and we went up to the Closerie des Lilas to
have a drink."
"“Rich feathercats with no money.”

“We’re awfully lucky.”

“We’ll have to be good and hold it.”

We both touched wood on the café table and the waiter came to see what
it was we wanted."
"But what we wanted not he, nor anyone else, nor
knocking on wood or on marble, as this café table-top was, could ever
bring us."
"If he could write a book as fine as
_The Great Gatsby_ I was sure that he could write an even better one."
"_Hawks Do Not Share_


Scott Fitzgerald invited us to have lunch with his wife Zelda and his
little daughter at the furnished flat they had rented at 14 rue Tilsitt."
"I cannot remember much about the flat except that it was gloomy and
airless and that there was nothing in it that seemed to belong to them
except Scott’s first books bound in light blue leather with the titles
in gold."
"Scott was
nervous and hospitable and he showed us his accounts of his earnings as
though they had been the view."
"He had
decided, he told me, to work hard and not to drink and Zelda was
treating him as though he were a kill-joy or a spoilsport."
"She was formally pleasant to Hadley and me but a big part of her seemed
not to be present but to still be on the party she had come home from
that morning."
"She and Scott both seemed to feel that Scott and I had
enjoyed a great and wonderful time on the trip up from Lyon and she was
jealous about it."
"Scott was being the perfect host and we ate a very bad lunch that the
wine cheered a little but not much."
"Watching her face you could see her mind leave the table and go
to the night’s party and return with her eyes blank as a cat’s and then
pleased, and the pleasure would show along the thin line of her lips and
then be gone."
"They would quarrel and then make up and he would sweat
out the alcohol on long walks with me, and make up his mind that this
time he would really work, and would start off well."
"Becoming unconscious when they drank had
always been their great defense."
"Scott told me about the Riviera and how my wife and I must come there
the next summer and how we would go there and how he would find a place
for us that was not expensive and we would both work hard every day and
swim and lie on the beach and be brown and only have a single apéritif
before lunch and one before dinner."
"When he had very bad times, I listened to him about them and tried to
make him know that if he could hold onto himself he would write as he
was made to write, and that only death was irrevocable."
"They would find an inexpensive
villa for us and this time he would not drink and it would be like the
old good days and we would swim and be healthy and brown and have one
apéritif before lunch and one before dinner."
"He had money
coming in from a dramatization of _The Great Gatsby_ which was running
well and it would sell to the movies and he had no worries."
"I had been down in Madrid in May working by myself and I came by train
from Bayonne to Juan-les-Pins third class and quite hungry because I had
run out of money stupidly and had eaten last in Hendaye at the
French-Spanish frontier."
"It was a nice villa and Scott had a very fine
house not far away and I was very happy to see my wife who had the villa
running beautifully, and our friends, and the single apéritif before
lunch was very good and we had several more."
"I knew everything was all right and was going to
turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling
me her great secret, “Ernest, don’t you think Al Jolson is greater than
Jesus?”

Nobody thought anything of it at the time."
"_A Matter of Measurements_


Much later, in the time after Zelda had what was then called her first
nervous breakdown and we happened to be in Paris at the same time, Scott
asked me to have lunch with him at Michaud’s restaurant on the corner of
the rue Jacob and the rue des Saints-Pères."
"He drank wine at the lunch but it did not affect him and he had not
prepared for the lunch by drinking before it."
"I knew that he was writing something good and that he was having
great trouble with it for many reasons but that was not what he wanted
to talk about."
"I kept waiting for it to come, the thing that I had to
tell the absolute truth about; but he would not bring it up until the
end of the meal, as though we were having a business lunch."
"Finally when we were eating the cherry tart and had a last carafe of
wine he said, “You know I never slept with anyone except Zelda.”

“No, I didn’t.”

“I thought I had told you.”

“No."
"We came back into the room and sat down at the table."
"Go
over to the Louvre and look at the people in the statues and then go
home and look at yourself in the mirror in profile.”

“Those statues may not be accurate.”

“They are pretty good."
"But you came to lunch to ask me
a question and I’ve tried to give you an honest answer.”

But he was still doubtful."
"_There Is Never Any End to Paris_


When there were the three of us instead of just the two, it was the cold
and the weather that finally drove us out of Paris in the winter time."
"My
wife could go to work at the piano in a cold place and with enough
sweaters keep warm playing and come home to nurse Bumby."
"The most ignorant and
prejudiced said that a cat would suck a baby’s breath and kill him."
"He never
cried on the trip and laughed happily when he would be barricaded in a
bunk so he could not fall out when we were in heavy weather."
"The rooms at the Taube were large and comfortable with big stoves, big
windows and big beds with good blankets and feather coverlets."
"The meals
were simple and excellent and the dining room and the wood-planked
public bar were well heated and friendly."
"The pension was about two dollars a day for the
three of us, and as the Austrian schilling went down with inflation, our
room and food were less all the time."
"Herr Walther Lent who was a
pioneer high-mountain skier and at one time had been a partner with
Hannes Schneider, the great Arlberg skier, making ski waxes for climbing
and all snow conditions, was starting a school for Alpine skiing and we
both enrolled."
"We were always hungry and every meal time was a great event."
"Sometimes for dinner there would be jugged hare with a rich red
wine sauce, and sometimes venison with chestnut sauce."
"Once or twice a week there was a
poker game in the dining room of the hotel with all the windows
shuttered and the door locked."
"Gambling was forbidden in Austria then
and I played with Herr Nels, the hotel keeper, Herr Lent of the Alpine
ski school, a banker of the town, the public prosecutor and the captain
of Gendarmerie."
"Then the room was warm, there was breakfast of fresh bread or
toast with delicious fruit preserves and big bowls of coffee, fresh eggs
and good ham if you wanted it."
"I remember the snow on the road to the village squeaking at night when
we walked home in the cold with our skis and ski poles on our shoulders,
watching the lights and then finally seeing the buildings, and how
everyone on the road said, “Grüss Gott.” There were always country men
in the _Weinstube_ with nailed boots and mountain clothes and the air
was smoky and the wooden floors were scarred by the nails."
"I remember the trails up through the orchards and the fields of the
hillside farms above the village and the warm farm houses with their
great stoves and the huge wood piles in the snow."
"The women worked in
the kitchens carding and spinning wool into grey and black yarn."
"The wool was natural and
the fat had not been removed, and the caps and sweaters and long scarves
that Hadley knitted from it never became wet in the snow."
"Only the public prosecutor and the banker drank with
him, and they were at a separate table."
"Snow was late that year and the hills and
mountain slopes were still warm from the sun when a great snowfall came."
"We became great students of avalanches, the different
types of avalanches, how to avoid them and how to behave if you were
caught in one."
"He had squatted down and made a box with his arms in front of
his head, as we had been taught to do, so that there would be air to
breathe as the snow rose up over you."
"So were the table and chairs."
"We slept close together in the
big bed under the feather quilt with the window open and the stars close
and very bright."
"In the morning after breakfast we all loaded to go up
the road and started the climb in the dark with the stars close and very
bright, carrying our skis on our shoulders."
"She was a great
mountain skier, small and beautifully built, who could carry as heavy a
rucksack as I could and carry it longer."
"Finally towards spring there was the great glacier run, smooth and
straight, forever straight if our legs could hold it, our ankles locked,
we running so low, leaning into the speed, dropping forever and forever
in the silent hiss of the crisp powder."
"The winter of the avalanches
was like a happy and innocent winter in childhood compared to the next
winter, a nightmare winter disguised as the greatest fun of all, and the
murderous summer that was to follow."
"He enters and leaves
politics or the theater in the same way he enters and leaves countries
and people’s lives in his early days."
"The work was as good and the
happiness was greater but no novel had been written, so they could not
be sure."
"In those days I trusted the pilot fish as I would trust the Corrected
Hydrographic Office Sailing Directions for the Mediterranean, say, or
the tables in _Brown’s Nautical Almanac_."
"When they said, “It’s great, Ernest."
"Truly it’s great."
"I worked well and we made great trips, and I thought we
were invulnerable again, and it wasn’t until we were out of the
mountains in late spring, and back in Paris that the other thing started
again."
